# WASD CODE brain replacement

Turns out my CODE keyboard has a removable controller module. It's a nice

# Uploading firmware

So it turns out that `dfu-util` works with the ST bootloader over USB.

1. Jumper the board to boot from ROM.
2. Get a raw binary format file.
3. Run: `dfu-util -d 0483:df11 --alt 0 -s 0x08000000 -D path_to_file.bin`
